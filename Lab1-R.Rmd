In this lab, we will learn how to use R to construct phylogenetic trees using some basic algorithms,
such as UPGMA and Neighbour-joining, etc.

Please download the [alignment](ABCD.fasta), and save it into your working directory. 

```{r}
library("ape")
library(phangorn)
alg = read.FASTA("ABCD.fasta")
```

```{r}
# setwd("~/WorkSpace/BioSci700")
alg = read.FASTA("ABCD.fasta")
```

```{r}
# 20 sites
d = dist.dna(alg, model = "raw") * 20
```
