### Mac version issues

Note that the Mac version of TempEst and FigTree may have an issue 
where they incorrectly prompt for the installation of Java 1.6. 
This is a known bug and does not affect the functionality of the programs. 
To run FigTree or TempEst, you can simply extract and launch the executable version
(e.g., FigTree_v1.4.4.tgz) without needing to install Java 1.6 separately.

To start FigTree, run the following command in the terminal: 

```bash
cd /Applications/FigTree1.4.4
bin/figtree 
```

If `figtree` is not executable in your machine, 
run the following command in the terminal before starting FigTree: 

```bash
chmod u+x bin/figtree
```
